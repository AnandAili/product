# Execution phase specifications

The execution phase is entered when the decision has been taken that the playground will become smoke-free.

## Action 1: Set a date
This first step in the execution phase is to set a date for the playground to become smoke-free. The date
can only be set by the playground manager.
To assist in determining a suitable date the system offers a set of tips.

A playground manager is able to adjust the date after it has been set, but once the date has been reached
it is no longer possible to adjust the date. The system should inform the user about this rule when setting
a date.

It is possible to set the date in the past in order to simply register the fact that a playground is already
smoke-free.

## Action 2: Share decision
The next step is to share the good news so any people as possible know about it, avoiding surprises and
inspiring people to do the same for other playgrounds.
The system offers templates with a suitable text for various media:
- press announcement
- playground newsletter
- playground website
For each medium there is an indicator to state that the decision was shared. This indicator can be set and cleared by
any workspace member.

### Social media confetti ðŸŽ‰ 
The system offers a facility where volunteers agree to post a social media message at a future date. The system releases
all these posts at that date at the same time, for maximum social media impact.

Each playground member is able to join the confetti in which case the system offers a standard text which a user can modify
and a selection of social media to post the message. (TBD (facebook, twitter, google+))
The system keeps track of which users joined the social media confetti.

Any volunteer is able to detonate the social media confetti. (CHECK: or show the date be established in advance?)

TODO: Check whether this kind of facility comply with the terms&conditions of the social media platforms we use.

## Action 3: Make it visible
To make it clear to the community that the playground will be/is smoke-free, it should be shown:
- The playground's policy should reflect this. The playground manager can indicate to the system that this has been done.
- The playground's website should clearly state this and bear the smoke-free logo. Any volunteer can indicate
in the system that this has been done. The system provides a template html text and allows users to download
the smoke-free logo.
- The smoke-free sign should be installed on the playground's fence. Only the playground manager can order the sign. These rules apply:
  - When a sign has already been ordered in the past for this playground then it is not possible to order
another one.
  - The user enters his name and address details. These details are not stored in the system. (TBD: perhaps we should use the playground's address?)
  - The system sends an e-mail to a configured e-mail address containing the request for the sign, a link to the
playground workspace and the name and address details of the user. The people behind this mailbox will take
care of sending the sign to the user.
  - The system records the fact that the user has ordered the sign. It is shown in the playground workspace which
user has ordered the sign.
 - Any user with the playground manager role can indicate that he has installed the sign on the playground's fence. Note that this can
 also be done without first having ordered the smoke-free sign as there are other ways to obtain the sign as well.

## Action 4: Party !
We like the idea of opening the smoke-free playground with a party. This establishes a good mood and is another
chance to shed light on the importance of creating a smoke-free generation.

The system allows the volunteers to set a theme and a date and time for the party. The party date may not be earlier than
the smoke-free date. The system will display a warning when a party date is set that does not equal the smoke-free date, because
we recommend that these dates coincide.

Each team member can specify a contribution to the party. The contribution is stated in clear text, for example 'supply drinks'.
Monetary donations are not yet supported.

TODO: Do we want to provide party packages that the users can order?
