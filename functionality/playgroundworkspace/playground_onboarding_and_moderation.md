# Playground onboarding and moderation

## Onboarding

### Onboarding a playground
When the user selects a playground for which the smoke-free process has not been start yet, he has two options:
- Sign the smoke-free petition for that playground. The endorsement will be registered, but the smoke-free process is not started.
- Initiate the smoke-free process and thereby become the playground moderator. It should be made clear to the user what this responsibility
entails so the user will not take this challenge too lightly.

When the smoke-free process has already started the user has he option to:
- Sign the smoke-free petition
- View the playground workspace. Here the user is able to see everything the volunteers in that playground are able to see, but the user
is not able to perform any action.
- Request to join the playground workspace. This request needs to be accepted by a playground moderator. When the playground moderator does not
accept the request within 5 days, the user is admitted automatically.

### Leaving a playground
Volunteers are free to leave a playground at any time. They will no longer receive notifications and will need to re-apply if they want to
join the playground workspace again. All actions performed by the user and chat messages posted by the user will remain intact.

Somebody with the playground manager role is also free to leave, but if he is the only one with this role he is urged not to leave (but not stopped from leaving)
until somebody else has taken over this role.

A playground moderator is also free to leave, but if he is the only playground moderator and there are still other volunteers in the playground workspace
 he will asked to consider assigning somebody else as moderator.


## Moderation
A playground should have always have a playground moderator so that somebody is able to moderate the content that is posted in the workspace chat box and
is able to accept entry requests from volunteers. However a playground workspace is able to operate without a playground moderator.

### Playground moderator role
These rules apply for the role of playground moderator:
- initially the person that creates the playground workspace will be the moderator
- a playground moderator can assign the playground moderator role to any volunteer in the same playground workspace
- any number of volunteers can get the playground moderator role
- a playground moderator can take away the playground moderator role from any other playground moderator in the same playground workspace
- a playground moderator can let go of this role and continue as a regular volunteer
- like any volunteer the playground moderator can leave the playground workspace
- when the last remaining playground moderator relinquishes his role or leaves the workspace the playground becomes unmoderated (see below)
- volunteers can request the playground moderator role. A playground moderator
needs to grant or deny this request.

### Active moderator
An active playground moderator performs these moderation tasks:
- granting or denying access to the playground workspace to users that have requested access
- granting or denying the playground moderator role to other volunteers that have requested this role
- reviewing and deleting chat messages that the moderator deems inappropriate, possible triggered by flags set by regular volunteers
- removing volunteers with inappropriate behaviour from the workspace

### Inactive moderator
When the playground moderator is not responsive moderation actions will be performed automatically:
- workspace admittance requests are granted automatically after 5 days
- workspace moderator role claims are granted automatically after 5 days
- flagged chat messages are deleted automatically after 5 days

### Unmoderated
These rules apply to playgrounds without a playground moderator:
- anyone can instantly claim the playground moderator role
- invitation requests to the playground workspace are granted instantly. (The user joins as a regular volunteer.)
- flagged chat messages get deleted immediately
