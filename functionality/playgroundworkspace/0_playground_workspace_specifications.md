# Playground workspace specifications

## Phases and actions

There are three phases: Preparation, Execution and Sustain
- Each phase consists of a set of actions. The actions of a phase cannot be manipulated before the previous phase is complete.
- Anonymous user can view all content in any playground workspace, but they cannot make adjustments that affect the state of the system
and nor can they perform any other actions with side-effects such as sharing content on social media, sending invites, etc. Allowing anonymous users to see the content implicitly allows them to see ALL chat history between the volunteers as well. We should make sure that it's clear to volunteers that all communication is public.
- The workspace has various progress indicators. Unless specified otherwise indicators can be set and unset/adjusted by any user
in the workspace.
- The completion of a phase cannot be undone (In sprint 4 this will be reconsidered, as probably the playground moderator will need
to be able to revert a phase completion)
- Actions do not need to be completed sequentially. In individual cases there may be a constraint on an action that relates to the state of another action
