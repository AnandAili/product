# Playground workspace specifications

## Phases and actions

There are three phases: Preparation, Execution and Sustain
- Each phase consists of a set of actions. The actions of a phase cannot be manipulated before the previous phase is complete.
- Anonymous users can view all content in any playground workspace, but they cannot make adjustments that affect the state of the system
and nor can they perform any other actions with side-effects such as sharing content on social media, sending invites, etc. Allowing anonymous users to see the content implicitly allows them to see ALL chat history between the volunteers as well. We should make sure that it's clear to volunteers that all communication is public.
- The workspace has various progress indicators. Unless specified otherwise indicators can be set and unset/adjusted by any user
in the workspace.
- The completion of a phase cannot be undone (At a later stage this will be reconsidered, as probably the playground moderator will need
to be able to revert a phase completion)
- Actions do not need to be completed sequentially. In individual cases there may be a constraints on an action that relates to the state of another action

## Statuses

Playground smokefree initiatives have status. The status is closely related to the phase, but not quite the same. It is derived from the detailed information stored in the initiative and in turn used to set constraints on the possible actions in the playground workspace. The pins on the overview
map are colored as an indication of the status of the initiative.

We distinguish the following statuses:
- initial: The initiative is defined, but without any volunteers. Typically this can be the case for predefined playgrounds.
- prepare: The initiative has volunteers but has not yet decided to become smokefree.
- execute: The decision to become smokefree has been made, but the smokefree date has not yet been reached
- sustain: The smokefree date has been reached, but the initiative does not comply with the smokefree criterion below.
- smokefree: The smokefree date has been reached and there has been a streak of 10 consecutive non-smoking observations over a period of four weeks all on different days.

Note that although an initiative will typically advance through these statusses sequentially, it is possible to 'go backwards' as the underlying facts change (for instance replanning of the smokefree date).
