# Playground workspace specifications

On the ground principle of [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) localmotion defines three phases: Preparation, Execution and Sustain

## Phases, statusses and actions

Playground smokefree initiatives have a status. The status is closely related to the phase, but not quite the same. It is derived from the detailed information stored in the initiative and in turn used to set constraints on the possible actions in the playground workspace. The pins on the overview map are colored as an indication of the status of the initiative. 

- Each phase consists of a set of actions. The actions of a phase cannot be manipulated before the previous phase is complete.
- Anonymous users can view all content in any playground workspace, but they cannot make adjustments that affect the state of the system
and nor can they perform any other actions with side-effects such as sharing content on social media, sending invites, etc. Allowing anonymous users to see the content implicitly allows them to see ALL chat history between the volunteers as well. We should make sure that it's clear to volunteers that all communication is public.
- The workspace has various progress indicators. Unless specified otherwise indicators can be set and unset/adjusted by any user
in the workspace.
- The completion of a phase cannot be undone (At a later stage this will be reconsidered, as probably the playground moderator will need
to be able to revert a phase completion)
- Actions do not need to be completed sequentially. In individual cases there may be a constraints on an action that relates to the state of another action

### Initial (Blue)
The initiative is defined, but without any volunteers. Typically this can be the case for predefined playgrounds.
- no actions

### Preperation (Red)
- start a team of people
- contact playground manager (convince)
  flyer, getting signatures for this specific playingground in your community, use signatures to convice manager
- Decide who is teamleader (manager); He is spokeperson for parents, volunteers and other interested parties.

Criteria: Teamleader decides if playingground can go to execution phase

### Execution (Yellow)
- Make a planning
- Set a date to make playground smokefree
- Share decision (Internally and externally)
- Show decision (Adjust regulation, put new rules on website, order and place sign)
- Adjust playground (remove all ash trays, ciggerete ends, maybe buy new playground materials)

Criteria: When date set to make playground smokefree is hit, go to check & sustain

### Sustain: Checking status (Green)
First weeks of a smokefree playingground are crucial. Parties around the playingground need to be reminded that the playingground is smokefree.
- Start a positive conversation if someone is smoking
- Validate if playingground is smokefree

Criteria: The smokefree date has been reached and there has been a streak of 10 consecutive non-smoking observations over a period of four weeks all on different days.

### Sustain: Smokefree (Dark Green)
Playingground has been one month smokefree. 
- Share this milestone with all parties.
- Evaluate 
    - Are there still any adjustments needed to make the new rules clear
    - If the area around the playingground is not smokefree, what is the next step?
- Show which other playgrounds need your help.

*Note that although an initiative will typically advance through these statusses sequentially, it is possible to 'go backwards' as the underlying facts change (for instance replanning of the smokefree date).*
