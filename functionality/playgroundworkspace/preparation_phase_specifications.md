# Preparation phase specifications

The preparation phase is the first phase in the process. It can be initiated by anyone at anytime.

## Action 1: Get Support
The goal of this action is to get more volunteers involved in this playground workspace
and to get other kinds of contributions such as endorsements and donations.

### Share on social media
- By clicking an appropriate icon the user shares a predefined message (TBD but something like
   'I am volunteering to make playground [playground name] smoke-free. Please click [link]here[end_link] to join me!')
- Social media to be supported are: facebook, whatsapp, [CHECK]

### Send an invite
- A user can invite somebody to join this playground workspace by specifying an email address
- The e-mail is sent by the user's own e-mail program and is sent from the user's own e-mail address
- The mail is formatted according to this template [REF]
- This mail contains a invitation-specific link that the user is urged to click.
- The fact that the user clicked to invitation-specific link is recording in the system.
- sprint 4: The link take the user to the accept/decline/contribute page.
- The system stores the email addresses to which an invite was sent
- The system does not distinguish whether the e-mail address belongs to a user that
is already present in the system or not
- The system displays a list of all invitations that have been sent along with an indication
of whether the user has invitation-specific link. Note that the system does not disclose the decision
of the invitee whether to accept the invite and/or contribute in another way.
- sprint 4: invitations to users that are on the blacklist is presented in the playground workspace
as having been sent, but is not actually sent.
- If an invitee did not click the link and invitation is over a week old, then a remind button is shown.
- When a user click the remind button a reminder mail according to this template [REF] is prepared for sending
and opened in the user's own e-mail program
- Invitations older than 4 weeks are no longer displayed (no matter whether the invitee has acted or not)
