# Glossary

These terms are commonly used in LocalMotion. Avoid synonyms when referring to these concepts.
- Initiative: Collaboration by a group of people to reach a common goal. In LocalMotion the goal is typically bound to a location.
- Member: A person who collaborates in an Initiative is a member of that initiative.
- Playground: A specific type of Initiative, namely a smokefree-playground initiative. Use this term only when referring to an initiative in this specific
context, otherwise use Initiative. 
- Manager: a specific type of member in an Initiative which more rights to issue commands. Currently this is not a generic concept and therefore only
used for smokefree playground initiatives. (In the future we may require a more elaborate role system)
- Moderator: A generic role of pre-authorised people that moderate the entire system.
